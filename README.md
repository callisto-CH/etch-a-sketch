# etch-a-sketch

This is an etch-a-sketch project created for The Odin Project. Will be updated with random color and transparency functionalities. Additionally, the way the grid is generated will be reworked, as its size does not cleanly line up with the cells. This is apparent if you zoom in, and is especially obvious for certain numbers (56, 57, 66, 67, or 69 for instance) where cells will overflow onto a new row. If only computers could calculate decimals with infinite precision.
